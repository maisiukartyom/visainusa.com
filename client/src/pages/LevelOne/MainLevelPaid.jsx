          <TextBlockone className="text-levelOne"  title=" The duration of the EB-3 unskilled visa process can vary significantly,
            with observed cases ranging from 18 months to nearly 60 months. Audits, requests for evidence, and retrogression add complexity,

              for obtaining a green card through this category. TDue to the unpredictable nature of these circumstances, it is challenging to pinpoint an exact duration for individual cases. As a general guideline, we advise individuals that the process may take between 3 to 4 years on average to obtain a green card through the EB-3 unskilled visa category. "

            description1="In the graphic chart below, you can observe the entire process for adjustment of status applicants under the best-case scenario, excluding delays such as audits, requests for evidence, and retrogression. The first step in your EB3 journey is the Labor Certification, which typically takes 8 to 12 months for approval.
            After the approval of the Labor Certification, it's essential to check the visa bulletin to determine eligibility for concurrent filing of forms I-140 (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker), I-131(Advance Parole), I-765 (Work Permit), and I-485 (green card application). It's important to note that retrogression does not impact the Labor Certification and I-140 steps. Even if your priority date is not yet current in the visa bulletin, you can file the I-140 to secure your LC and prevent it from expiring. The premium processing option for I-140 takes 15 business days, offering the only means to expedite the EB3 process. In contrast, regular processing may take 8-10 months. If your priority date is not current after I-140 approval, you must patiently wait until it becomes current. The visa bulletin is updated monthly, but predicting when the retrogression will end is nearly impossible. 
            It's crucial to maintain lawful status in the U.S. until Form I-140 is approved and Form I-485 is filed. As soon as I-765 and I-131 are approved which typically takes 2-3 months from submission, you should start working in your unskilled job with your sponsor and can also travel internationally. The approval time for Form I-485 is approximately 12 months. This implies that you may be invited for the immigration interview around the midpoint of your 1-year obligation period. Following the successful acquisition of the green card and the fulfillment of your commitment to your sponsor, you gain the flexibility to work and reside anywhere in the U.S. It's crucial to note that only the main applicant has an obligation toward the sponsor, while all dependents, having obtained I-765 approval, are free to work anywhere in the U.S.

             three pathways to apply for EB3 unskilled:"
             description1=" 1. Adjustment of status (AOS): If you are in the U.S. on B status, completing the entire adjustment of status 
            (AOS) from within the U.S. might not be possible. B status allows you to stay in the U.S. for up to 6 months,
             while AOS may take 2-4 years. You can attempt to extend B status for an additional 6 months, but it may still
              not be sufficient. You can apply for EB3 unskilled while you have valid B status and change your B status to 
              another non-immigrant status, such as J or F, which allows you to maintain your lawful status as long as you c
              ontinue enrolling in SEVIS-approved schools. There is no time limit on how long you can keep student status. If, for
               any reason, your change of B status to F status is denied, you can apply for EB3 and must depart the U.S. before your
                B status expires. You can then re-enter the U.S. in valid B status for AOS filing after your Labor Certification (LC)
                 is approved and the priority date is current. Holding F status allows you to legally work only up to 20 hours on 
                 the school's campus. Under difficult life situations, you can request USCIS to obtain an employment authorization 
                 document (EAD/work permit) to work outside of the school campus. As an alternative option to earn money under F
                  status, you can create a legal entity. However, you need to hire someone with a valid EAD to work in your company,

                   as you can't be involved in the daily routine business activities. This means you can receive income only as a beneficiary.
                    Having F status, you can apply for political asylum if you have a case for it. The pending asylum status provides the legal
                     right to work in the U.S.
                    while you wait for the immigration interview under your political case. It is important to emphasize that you must have
                     F status and pending asylum status simultaneously to undergo the immigration interview under EB3 unskilled inside the U.S. 
                     Otherwise, having only pending asylum status, you most likely need to leave the U.S. to undergo the immigration interview for
                      the EB3 unskilled visa category." description2="2. Start with consular processing (CP) and transition to adjustment of status (AOS). If you 
                      are not in the U.S. but have a B visa, you can initiate the EB3 process from outside the U.S. and conclude it inside the U.S. The process involves the following steps:
                       Labor Certification (LC): Your U.S. employer must obtain a labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor. This involves 
                       demonstrating that there are no qualified U.S. workers available for the position and that hiring you will not negatively impact
                        the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. Form I-140 Petition: After the labor certification is
                         approved, your U.S. employer files Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, on your behalf with U.S. Citizenship and 
                         Immigration Services (USCIS). Visa Bulletin and Priority Date: Monitor the Visa Bulletin to check when your priority date
                          becomes current. Due to annual numerical limits on immigrant visas, there may be a waiting period (retrogression). Travel
                           to the U.S. on B Status: Once your priority date is current, you can plan a temporary trip to the U.S. on your B visa.
                            Ensure you have evidence of your intent to return to your home country and maintain ties to your home country. Please
                             note that, in general, an approved I-140 alone does not mean you have immigrant intent. That means if you are outside
                              the U.S. and going through consular processing, you may continue to travel to the U.S. if you have a valid temporary 
                              visa (like a B1/B2) after the I-140 is approved. However, you will need to stop traveling to the U.S. using the temporary
                               visa once the National Visa Center (NVC) has collected all of your documents and sent your case to the U.S. consulate 
                               for final processing and the consular interview. Once you receive notice from the NVC that your case has been sent to
                                the consulate, you should not attempt to enter the U.S. until you have the immigrant visa in hand after your consular 
                                interview. Adjustment of Status (AOS): If your intent changes, and you decide to adjust your status after entering the
                                 U.S., you can file for Adjustment of Status (AOS). It is generally advised to wait at least 60 days from your last entry on
                                  a B visa before filing for AOS. Remain in the U.S. for Processing: Once you file for AOS, you must remain in the U.S. until
                                   Advanced Parole (travel parole) is issued. During this period, you are not permitted to work until your Employment 
                                   Authorization Document (EAD) is issued. The approval time for Advance Parole and Employment Authorization Document is about 5
                                    - 7 months. It means that after your entry into the U.S., you will not have the right to travel internationally and work for
                                     up to 7 months while waiting for the approval of Advance Parole and Employment Authorization Document."
                                     description3="3. Start with Adjustment of Status (AOS) and conclude with Consular Processing (CP). If you initially apply for EB3
                                      unskilled through Adjustment of Status (AOS) while residing inside the U.S., and later decide to leave the U.S. for any reason,
                                       you can file Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition, to request consular processing.
                                        However, this transfer is likely to add an additional lag of 5 to 10 months to the timeframe. Switching from AOS to Consular
                                         Processing is only possible after filing Form I-140 with USCIS. During the Labor Certification stage, you can leave the U.S.
                                          without filing the I-824 form. Only after the Labor Certification is approved do you need to choose between Adjustment
                                           of Status or Consular Processing. This pathway may also help address unauthorized work in the U.S. If you worked without
                                            authorization for over 180 days since your last entry into the U.S. but maintained valid status (i.e., your I-94 has not
                                               expired or you have a timely filed extension), you will need to undergo Consular Processing. This means that once your
                                                Labor Certification (LC) and I-140 immigration petition are approved, you will need to leave the U.S. to apply for

                                                 can help you obtain the green card, as U.S. embassy officers will not consider your unauthorized work in the U.S. as 
                                                 a violation. "

                                                 description4="F status (student)
          In terms of success rate, having F status is considered one of the best options for applying for EB3 unskilled.
           There is no time limit on how long you can maintain student status, as long as you continue enrolling in SEVIS-approved 
           schools. You can choose English language courses, community college, or a university—whatever you can afford. Your family 
           members will have F2 status and can reside in the U.S. legally. Students typically face the first challenge of a lack of 
           income. Working without an Employment Authorization Document significantly decreases your chances of obtaining a
            permanent resident card/green card in the U.S. Any job performed without authorization is considered unauthorized, 
            regardless of whether taxes were paid. Furthermore, receiving payment in cash for any job within the U.S. or performing 
            tasks remotely, including but not limited to teaching, accounting, or coding, for a company located outside of the U.S.
             without the proper authorization is also deemed unauthorized work. Volunteering is allowed, but taking on positions
              typically held by paid employees is generally prohibited. Students have authorization to make financial investments
               for capital generation, such as investing in stocks or bonds and being involved passively as an investor, without
                participating in productive work for the company. However, actively engaging in the day-to-day operations of a
                 business or participating in active Forex trading is not allowed. Holding F status allows you to work legally for
                  up to 20 hours on the school's campus. In difficult life situations, you can try to request an Employment 
                  Authorization Document (EAD/work permit) from USCIS to work outside of the school campus. As an alternative 
                  option to earn money under F status, you can create or buy a legal entity. However, you need to hire someone with 
                  a valid Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to work in your company since you cannot be involved in the daily
                   routine business activities. This means you can only receive income as a beneficiary. It is crucial to maintain
                    F status in the U.S. at least until Form I-140 is approved, and Form I-485 is filed. To be on the safe side,
                     it is better to continue keeping your F status until you have your green card in hand. The crucial point is 
                     that if, for any reason, you are denied during the immigration interview under EB3 unskilled (due to a failed
                      medical exam, unauthorized work, unlawful status, or your sponsor's fault), you will not become illegal since
                       you have valid F status.In some cases, with F status, you can apply for political asylum if you have a case to do so. The pending asylum status provides the legal right to work in the U.S. while you wait for the immigration interview under your political case. It is important to emphasize that you must have both F status and pending asylum status simultaneously to undergo the immigration interview under EB3 unskilled within the U.S. Otherwise, if you have only pending asylum status, you most likely need to leave the U.S. to undergo the immigration interview for the EB3 unskilled visa category. Another advantage of having F status is that you can start working for your sponsor in an unskilled job based on your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) under the OPT program while your EAD under EB3 is not yet approved. This way, you can fulfill the 12-month commitment sooner. The disadvantage of F status is the absence of a work permit to work outside of your school's campus."/>

          1) if you have serious health problems, as you will be required to undergo a medical examination before the immigration interview.
           Immigrants and refugees must undergo a medical exam as part of the immigration process for entry into the United States or adjustment of immigration status. The medical exam includes screening for any illness defined as a communicable disease of public health significance. The exams are conducted by doctors both in other countries and in the United States. Doctors who screen applicants outside of the United States are called 'panel physicians,' while those screening applicants in the United States are called 'civil surgeons.' Communicable diseases of public health significance that can prevent entry to the United States fall into three categories. Immigrants and refugees will not be allowed to enter the United States if they are detected with any of the following diseases listed in 42 CFR part 34: active tuberculosis, infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and infectious leprosy (Hansen’s disease). Quarantinable communicable diseases, designated by Presidential Executive Order, include cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndromes, and influenza caused by novel or re-emergent influenza viruses (pandemic flu). Communicable diseases may pose a public health emergency of international concern if they meet certain risk factors and either pose a threat of being imported into the U.S. or affect the health of the U.S. population. Moreover, communicable diseases for which a single case requires notification to the World Health Organization (WHO) as an event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern include pandemic flu, polio, 
          SARS, and smallpox.

In such a situation, if the officer asks you general questions like, 'Why did you decide to apply for the EB3 unskilled visa?' and your response is, 'I don't know what the EB3 visa is,' it may raise concerns about your understanding and commitment to the visa category. Or if the officer asks you questions such as, 'Who is your sponsor, where will you work, and what are your job duties?' and your response is, 'I do not know who my sponsor is, and I don't know that I need to work there,' it could raise serious concerns during the immigration interview. It's crucial to have a thorough understanding of your sponsor, job details, and the terms of your visa application. Being uninformed about such essential aspects may negatively impact the officer's assessment of your eligibility for the EB3 unskilled visa. It's important to be well-prepared for the interview and have a clear understanding of the visa you are applying for, as well as your intentions and obligations associated with it." description4=" 3) If your sponsor encounters issues such as no longer requiring unskilled workers, losing the ability to pay your salary for 12 months, or selling the business, it could potentially impact your EB3 unskilled visa application. In such situations, it's important to promptly address the changes and assess the impact on your visa application. You may need to notify the relevant authorities and explore potential solutions, such as finding a new sponsor or employer who can fulfill the required conditions. Pending the I-485 form for more than 6 months gives you the right to switch to a new sponsor and not start your EB3 process from scratch. The ability to switch sponsors would depend on various factors, and it's essential to consider the specifics of your situation. If you are considering changing sponsors during the I-485 process, you should be aware of the following: maintaining Eligibility - ensure that you continue to meet the eligibility criteria for the EB3 unskilled category. New Sponsor's Involvement - the new sponsor would need to file a new I-140 petition on your behalf. Priority Date - the priority date established with the initial I-140 petition may still be relevant. When switching sponsors, the new I-140 petition should have a current priority date or be in a category with a current priority date. Consistency with Original Petition - the new employment should align with the job offer presented in the original petition, and the new sponsor 
          should be willing to assume the obligations of the previous sponsor."/>
