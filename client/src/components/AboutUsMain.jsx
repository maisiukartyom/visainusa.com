               unskilled category, I checked with the USCIS. I eventually applied for the EB3 unskilled category. The process was
                lengthy, involving challenges at each step of the process. My Labor Certificate got randomly audited, my I-140 
                petition for the alien worker was denied, and there was a huge delay in scheduling the immigration interview due to
                 the transfer of my immigration case from my home country to the U.S. embassy in Poland,  and moreover my medical
                  exam required additional 6 weeks lab research. Despite all those challenges, I successfully passed the immigration
                   interview and received the immigration visa. Since crossing the U.S. border, I have been working at a local store 
                   as a grocery clerk.
